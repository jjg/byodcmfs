Build Your Own Didactic Computing Machine from Scrap.

Inspired by [David J. Gingery](https://www.gingerybookstore.com/davegingeryessay.html)'s [Build Your Own Metal Working Shop From Scrap](https://gingerybookstore.com/MetalWorkingShopFromScrap.html).


## Building

This book is written in Markdown and compiled to epub and pdf formats using the included build.sh script.


### Required Packages

* pandoc
* texlive-latex-recommended
* texlive-fonts-recommended

Once these are installed, run `./build.sh`.  The resulting files will appear in the `output` directory.  mupdf is my prefered means of reviewing the output.
